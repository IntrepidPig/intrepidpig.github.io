<p>I never know what to say in these things. I could say my name, my age, the name of my dog, but it all seems kinda pointless. Then again, all of the useful stuff is over in the <a href="/blog">blog</a>. So I guess I'll just write all the filler that usually goes here anyway.</p>
<p>My name is Benny Aguilera. I've been programming for many years now, but I'm still pretty inexperienced. I have a <script>var time = new Date() - new Date(2015, 8, 20);document.write(Math.floor(time / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365.25))</script> year old dog named Timber that is a German Shepherd-Australian Cattle Dog mix who as of writing this, is sleeping in my dirty laundry closet. I am <script>var time = new Date() - new Date(2001, 12, 12);document.write(Math.floor(time / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365.25))</script> years old, and currently attending high school.</p>
<p>My hobbies include programming, swimming, rock-climbing, playing trumpet, and the usual basic necessities for survival such as eating, sleeping, breathing, etc. I'd also like to add tree-climbing as another form of climbing I enjoy. In fact, let's go with *-climbing. I like climbing anything.</p>
