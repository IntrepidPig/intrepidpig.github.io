    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a junior undergraduate currently studying Computer Science and Mathematics at UC Berkeley. My aspiration is to work in a research-type position, either at a university or in a similar role under a company, which is the primary factor I take into account when choosing my courses. This semester I'm taking Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, and Cryptography. My classes are challenging but also the most interesting I have ever taken, and I am really enjoying my time here.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been programming since I was a kid and I still love it to date. These days almost everything I write is in Rust, although in the past I have worked extensively with Java, Python, C, and C++ as well. You can see some of the things I've made on <a href="https://github.com/IntrepidPig">my GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time I like to work on side projects, climb rocks, and listen to music.

                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/IntrepidPig/berlewelch">Berlekamp-Welch Error Correction</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        An implementation of the Berlekamp-Welch error correcting code algorithm that encodes messages as polynomials over a finite field to efficiently make them resistant to an upper bound of corruption errors. The theory of this topic was covered in my Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory course at Berkeley, but I decided to fully implement it (and an <a href="/projects/berlewelch">accompanying web interface</a>) as a side project.

                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/IntrepidPig/wally">Wally Wayland Compositor</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        A proof of concept compositor for the Wayland protocol built using the Rust language and Vulkan 3D graphics API. Notably, all of these are relatively young technologies, so was very little literature on using them together. Building this project required me to delve into the source code of several core components of my operating system, and eventually led to me reporting a bug and suggesting a fix in my graphics driver.

                    <p>
                        A compiler to bytecode for a self-designed programming language and an accompanying language virtual machine, both implemented in Rust. Minimal external libraries were used, nearly everything including parsing and code generation is written from scratch. Lexing is zero-copy and an intermediate representation in the form of a control-flow graph is partially implemented.

                    <p>
                        A simple neural network a built after reading the first couple chapters of <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html">this online book</a>. This was my first time applying nontrivial amounts of calculus and linear algebra to a programming project, and it was amazing to see the result.
